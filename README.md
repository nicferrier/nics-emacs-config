This is an attempt to make a new type of config for Emacs that will
actually be portable between a lot of machines.

I really like the go-lang/crystal-lang idea of just using git repos to
carry modules and then pulling in those.

So this config has tools to allow me to do that.

I also want just one file to initialize my emacs, though the obvious
way to handle emacs startup is with an after-init hook, so I write an
after-init file from the init file and I have tools to make that
possible.


## My involvement with Emacs

I have long periods where I do contribute to Emacs. Sadly, I am too
busy with other things which I consider more important right now.

I am sure the Emacs community is moving on in my absence and inventing
new ways to do this stuff... but this is mine and it works ok.
